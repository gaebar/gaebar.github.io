## Experience

#### Software Engineering Immersive course, General Assembly, London, May - August 2019

The course covers a vast array of content in three months, and it was a great way to get holistic knowledge to kick start my tech career. I was surrounded by very talented and interesting individuals from different backgrounds, which provided a new perspective and gave me the opportunity to explore this new domain. The most important takeaway from the course is the feeling that everything is achievable, and despite numerous challenges, I kept confidence in my ability to learn to code and found great value in asking people’s opinions and their reasoning behind decisions, as I feel this is truly the best way to learn.

## Previous Experience

#### April 2012 - May 2019: Teacher of Italian as a second language - freelance

I have been tutoring for several years and worked as a teacher of Italian as a second language for adults. The goal is for students to enjoy their lessons so that they become both excited by the subject and confident in their own ability to do well. I try to challenge them to think for themselves by encouraging active participation in each lesson. I provide full immersion in the Italian culture, art and traditions as well as language, often visiting relevant landmarks in London and abroad.
