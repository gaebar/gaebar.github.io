## Experience

#### Software Engineering Immersive course, General Assembly, London, May - August 2019

The course covers a vast array of content in three months, and it was a great way to get holistic knowledge to kick start my tech career.

Each day consists of a morning standup meeting with the class and instructional team to discuss progress and problems, then lessons and labs from 9-5 and daily homework (mini-projects), with 3 full project weeks and one 2-days hackathon.

##Course activities:

- Creating responsive web pages for modern browsers using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Building richly interactive, front-end single-page applications using React.
- Writing secure full-stack MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications
- Deploying dynamic apps on Heroku and static websites to Netlify
- Consuming web APIs from third-party sites such as Twilio, TFL, and Mapbox.
- Building RESTful APIs using MongoDB, Express and Flask with Python.
- Collaborating as a team using Git and GitHub.

## Previous Experience

#### April 2012 - May 2019: Teacher of Italian as a second language - freelance

I have been tutoring for several years and worked as a teacher of Italian as a second language for adults. The goal is for students to enjoy their lessons so that they become both excited by the subject and confident in their own ability to do well. I try to challenge them to think for themselves by encouraging active participation in each lesson. I provide full immersion in the Italian culture, art and traditions as well as language, often visiting relevant landmarks in London and abroad.
