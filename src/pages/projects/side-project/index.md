Side Project - solo

A work in progress little web app that take full advantage of the **<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Vision API</a>** to create something incredibly dumb.

AI Spy (with my little eys) it's a progressive experience in the fact that it works on both Android and iOS however with Android you get photos straight from the camera, speech synthesis (so you can play with a virtual friend) and the power of service worker, while on iOS the app is still fully functional for its MVP.
