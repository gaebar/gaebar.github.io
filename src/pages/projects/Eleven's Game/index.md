GA Project 1: Pac Man - 7 days, solo

An individual project built in just over a week, which was both the first game I had built and my first project using Vanilla JavaScript, having only been studying it for two weeks. Elevenâ€™sGame is a Stranger Things themed variation on the classic game Pac Man, a one-player game against a computer AI which intelligently hunts down the player.
