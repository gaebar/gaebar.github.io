Project 2: Digital Nomad Hub - 2 days, group of 2

We had to render an app that retrieves data from a public API in an interesting and engaging manner. We had just under 48 hours to achieve this goal, making it extremely time-sensitive. We chose to create a web app called Digital Nomad Hub, which allows users to retrieve a map of locations of potential destination for digitals nomads, using the Mapbox and Rapid webcams APIs.

My part in the project included creating a Mapbox API integration, display the results on the map and general styling of the map.
