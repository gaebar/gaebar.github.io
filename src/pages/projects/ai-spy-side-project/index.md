Side Project - solo

A work in progress web app, inspired by my background as Italian teacher to foreigners. A little family game for kids who want to play the popular guessing game or learn a new language.

AI Spy (with my little eyes) is a progressive web app that use the **<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Vision API</a>** to label photos from the camera. It then asks users to guess what the API has discovered in the picture.

I have been inspired to create this app by a presentation at Google I/O 2018: <a href="https://medium.com/coding-blocks/google-lens-firebase-54d34d7e1505" target="_blank">Creating a Google Lens clone using Firebase MLKit</a>

##Technical Stack
