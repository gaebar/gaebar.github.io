My name is **_Gaetano Barreca_**. I am a creative, ambitious, and enterprising software engineer.

A recognized / top ten seller published Italian novelist and former archeologist. I love art, collecting first editions of my favorite books and going to long walks. I have proudly worked at the British Museum and the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art.
